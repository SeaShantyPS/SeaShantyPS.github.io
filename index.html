  <p>Hello! We're Shanty — the OldSchool RSPS with Sea Shanty 2 vibes. We have a reimagined RuneScape world map, the Warding skill, and overall are the most thought-out RuneScape Private Server to exist.</p>
  <p>We know our website isn't the most... impressive right now. The thing is, our website is not currently made yet. However, you can check out our update blog <a href="/updates">here</a>! Moreover, our Rune-Server thread is <a href="https://www.rune-server.ee/runescape-development/rs2-server/projects/701423-shanty.html#post5763317">here</a> and our Discord can be found <a href="http://seashanty2.com/">here</a>.</p>
